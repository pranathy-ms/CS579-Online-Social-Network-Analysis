00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:16.109
Srivasa Pranathy Mutcherla: Okay. Hello. Our team consists of Kiran. While Amati and myself, we are working on a bipartite graph with a data set extracted from the Chicago data portal.

2
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:24.109
Srivasa Pranathy Mutcherla: It consists of the Progress Report cards of Chicago public schools from 2,011 to 2,012.

3
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:36.610
Srivasa Pranathy Mutcherla: The reason we chose this data set is that we wanted to have a societal impact with our analysis and knew that Chicago data portal is the way to go

4
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:45.110
Srivasa Pranathy Mutcherla: after trying out an energy data set and not finding a straightforward network model. We chose this data set

5
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.050
Srivasa Pranathy Mutcherla: under the education sector.

6
00:00:48.900 --> 00:01:05.470
Srivasa Pranathy Mutcherla: It covers 566 public schools, and has 79 columns covering attributes that are performance metrics of the school. Apart from their identifier data, like the name of the school, the address, the Zip code.

7
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:17.963
Srivasa Pranathy Mutcherla: The performance metrics varied across different topics, such as how equipped they were on a health basis, how well the schools had parent engagement.

8
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.679
Srivasa Pranathy Mutcherla: and their performance on a different grade scale rise.

9
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:38.369
Srivasa Pranathy Mutcherla: And the idea is to develop a network model after discretizing the relevant performance metrics to get accumulative value and map these goals and the respect of performance metrics.

10
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:48.999
Srivasa Pranathy Mutcherla: considering the large number of performance metrics that are available. We also need to consider columns that are

11
00:01:49.860 --> 00:02:10.760
Srivasa Pranathy Mutcherla: highly weighted and also have more cleaner values available to work on. And once that is achieved, if time permits, we would like to conduct an analysis to determine if there is a relation between schools lying in the same score, spectrum, like location or network manager, etc.

12
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.209
Srivasa Pranathy Mutcherla: And Kiran will be talking about the limitations now.

13
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.480
Kiran Velamati: Alright. Thank you.

14
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.219
Kiran Velamati: So we have few limitations which we feel might be a problem for conducting our analysis.

15
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.440
Kiran Velamati: Let's say, firstly, the data set consists of schools that are in network of

16
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.820
Kiran Velamati: cps, that is, Chicago public schools, which means the privately operated schools and

17
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.500
Kiran Velamati: charter schools that do not fall under Cps jurisdiction are not included

18
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.269
Kiran Velamati: which may limit comprehensive city-wide educational analysis.

19
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.610
Kiran Velamati: If we plan to develop and Ml. Model and gather insights

20
00:02:51.190 --> 00:03:00.099
Kiran Velamati: about the schools performing similarly based on their location, we might miss out on other private schools if they perform. Similarly.

21
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.289
Kiran Velamati: also, there are many instances of missing or incomplete data which may result in inaccurate results.

22
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:22.839
Kiran Velamati: Also, there may be bias in reporting such as school safety or parental involvement may lead to biases or inaccuracies, as schools might have incentives to portray themselves in a favourable light.

23
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.659
Kiran Velamati: Additionally, the data set represents

24
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:35.640
Kiran Velamati: at 2,011 to 2,012 a school year, which may not accurately reflect current conditions or trends educational trends.

25
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.880
Kiran Velamati: So it might impact the decision making model.

26
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.280
Kiran Velamati: That's it. Thank you.
